Main trouble rn being caused by castling.

Right now trying to tranfer isCheck to all pieces so it auto removes moves that are illegal and puts ur king as check

Highlighting:
Found small issue with highlighting on previous piece that just moved, highlighting can be removed but it should stay

Issues - Check:
king can capture piece even tho it will be checked

some black pawn cant diag kill at start or maybe when king is check

TypeError: document.getElementById(...) is null

Possible issue with castling also

Pieces:
Add king - checkmate and statemate

Chess Notations:
Qe2 Qxe2#: White queen moves to e2, Black queen captures on e2 and checkmates.
Example: e8=Q (pawn moves to e8 and promotes to a queen).

Types Of Draw:
Stalemate
Dead Position
Mutual Agreement
Threefold Repetition
50-Move Rule

Add click to move alongside drag on possible positions
Add undo/redo feature
Add flip board feature
Add markings with arrows feature (maybe not needed for local 2 player)

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Convert updateCoordinate so it does both html and the class

A hyperlink html tag is draggable and can be placed on board (NOT WANTED!)
