Notes:
Right now trying to tranfer isCheck to all pieces so it auto removes
moves that are illegal and puts ur king as check
(IDK IF I WILL DO THIS, TOO DIFFICULT TO THINK HOW TO DO IT,
MIGHT JUST KEEP IT THE SAME FOR NOW)

Highlighting:
Found small issue with highlighting on previous piece that just moved,
highlighting can be removed but it should stay

Issues - Check:
king can capture piece even tho it will be checked

some black pawn cant diag kill at start or maybe when king is check

Pieces:
Add king - checkmate and statemate

Chess Notations:
Qe2 Qxe2#: White queen moves to e2, Black queen captures on e2 and checkmates.
Example: e8=Q (pawn moves to e8 and promotes to a queen).

Types Of Draw:
Stalemate
Dead Position
Mutual Agreement
Threefold Repetition
50-Move Rule

Extra Features:
Add click to move alongside drag on possible positions
Add undo/redo feature
Add markings with arrows feature (maybe not needed for local 2 player)

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Convert updateCoordinate so it does both html and the class

A hyperlink html tag is draggable and can be placed on board (NOT WANTED!)

Maybe add toggle dark/light mode.

King can castle illegally and during that it results king being check

22/10/24 UPDATE:
Castling perfected, double castling is not possible rn
but I don't even know if its legal and if I should add it.
I believe pawn promotions are fixed

Issue: labels visual position looks weird when board is rotated
and the label is sharing the square with a piece
