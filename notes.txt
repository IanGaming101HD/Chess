Notes:
Add pawn en passent and promotion
Add king castling, checked and checkmated
Add player turns
Add chess notations when moving pieces
Add undo/redo feature
Add markings feature
Add markers/positions to show possible positions + add click to move instead of drag on possible positions

Chess Notations:
x represents piece being taken
+ represents check
Queen moves to a1 -> Qa1
Queen moves to pawn on a1 -> Qxa1
Queen moves on a1 and checks -> Qa1+
Pawn is only exception to being named, its the only unnamed piece in chess notation, if pawn moves from C4 and goes forward
Example of chess notation: [1. b4 d5  2. c4 dxc4 ]

Bugs (03/04/2024): 
Dragging and dropping pieces -> when trying to kill a piece it doesnt die and both pieces in same coordinate, 
somehow you can swap pieces (just add turn system to fix 50% of the problem), with knight it looks like it goes
somewhere else but it just not fitting in the coordinate coz of bug and the piece not dieing







MAIN ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS THAT SOMETIMES PIECES ARENT DELETING PROPERLY
